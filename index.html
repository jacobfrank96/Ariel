          <h2>Parent reviews</h2>
          <li>"Ariel has been my go to babysitter since I moved to St. Louis in January of 2014. She has handled 4 dogs and 3 kids in a tiny hotel room with ease. When we moved into our house it was even farther away and she still came at a moments notice. Over the past 2 years she has grown into more than a babysitter and I consider her a part of the family. This last year it was my daughters 7th birthday and she was here ready to celebrate and made my daughters wishes come true with a day of horseback riding. My three kids beg for Ariel to come over and she has been nothing more than reliable and I trust her with my life - and I don't trust many people to watch my kids. I don't know what I would do without this amazing lady as I don't have any family around to help me out and she's always there to lend a helping hand - even around the house, it always looks as though my house has been professionally cleaned when she leaves, which is such a relief because she's constantly looking out and trying to make my life easier in any way possible. I HIGHLY recommend Ariel for any of your needs and if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me."</li>
          <li>"Hire her."</li>
          <li>"Ariel has spent the last several months working with me in my in-home daycare. She has been an amazing asset. She is fantastic with the kids and helps come up with a ton of exciting activities! She has pushed me to become a better care provider (and a better cook!). You can't find anyone better to take care of your children! She's amazing! "</li>
